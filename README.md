# interactive-visualizations-dashboard-challenge
This Project taught me a lot about how Plotly works with arrays and a little bit about the use of layouts to really make data stand out. It will surely be one of my favorite libraries from Javascript as it's graphing has proven to be a lot more engaging than matplotlib with my level of knowledge. The most difficult task from this assignment was the top 10 OTU ID's. You can see from my code that it took me a fair amount of filtering and transformation in order for it to work the way that I wanted it to. I hope to learn quicker shortcuts for my transformation process and will continue to work on this project to figure out the best and most convenient way to do coloring of plots.
